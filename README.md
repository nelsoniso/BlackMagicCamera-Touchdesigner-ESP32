**BlackMagic Camera - Touchdesigner - ESP32**

This project aims to provide users with the ability to interact with a Black Magic camera from TouchDesigner. Whether it's for professional purposes or more experimental ones, such as controlling the camera's iris or focus using voice commands or motion gestures. The TouchDesigner project offers a user-friendly UI, with all the settings conveniently located in the main window. However, you can also access the 'CAMERA_CONTROL' container to adjust the inputs that trigger camera reactions or retrieve information from the camera.
